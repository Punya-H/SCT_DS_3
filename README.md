# SCT_DS_3

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of data science tasks including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling. The datasets used include the Titanic dataset, Bank Marketing dataset, and Traffic Accident data. The goal is to explore patterns, visualize insights, and build simple machine learning models.

## Features

* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
* Decision Tree Classifier for prediction
* Traffic accident trend and hotspot analysis

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Punya-H/SCT_DS_3.git
cd SCT_DS_3
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the scripts or open notebooks for each module:

```bash
python src/data_cleaning.py
python src/decision_tree_model.py
```

Or explore results in Jupyter notebooks inside the `notebooks/` folder.

## Tools & Libraries

* Python 3.8+
* pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
* scikit-learn, plotly

## Results

* Cleaned and analyzed multiple datasets
* Built a Decision Tree classifier for customer purchase prediction
* Identified accident patterns by weather, road, and time of day
